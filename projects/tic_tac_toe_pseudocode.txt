EH 1st tic tac toe pseudocode

import random

declare a list and make 2 more lists inside of the list that have each of the positions of the x's and o's in the tic tac toe grid

write a while True loop and have all of the code inside of the loop so that it will run continuously

then have one input between 1 and 9 that will tell which position to go in or have where they can type in a word to exit the code
the positions will be, 1 = top left, 2 = top middle = 3 = top right, and so on from there

then have an if statement that will trigger if the input is in the list

then have a another if statement inside of the if statement above that will trigger if the input = 1
then inside of this if statement you will have where it will print the x inside of that specific square
then you will have where the computer will pick a random choice between the 9 squares except for the square that the user has picked
then make a display statement that will display the board again with the computer's choice inside of the grid

then you will make 8 more of these else if statements that will do the same thing but in the different squares on the tic tac toe board.

then at the end of the else if statements you will have where if the user input = "exit", it will put a break function that
will kill the program

then at the end of all those if and else if statements, you will put a display statement that will show the user that it is an invalid input
if the input matches none of the if statements

then you will then make an if statement saying that if three squares are filled in a row, it will display that the user or computer has won
