#EHCP1 DND final pseudocode
#import random as r
#import time as t for time between print statements
#a print statement that welcomes the adventurer to the country of Draeburg
#list with the classes in it
#value = 0
#gold = 50
#level = 1
#list for the inventory
#heal
#while loop that only executes when the value is under 2
    #input that allows them to choose classes for their character such as barbarian, sorcerer, and more
    #strength = r.randint(1,20)
    #dexterity = r.randint(1,20)
    #constitution = r.randint(1,20)
    #intelligence = r.randint(1,20)
    #wisdom = r.randint(1,20)
    #charisma = r.randint(1,20)
    #health = r.randint(10,40)
    #if statements that check whether they are in a certain number range, then if it is in that number range, it gives a modifier
    #another user input that asks if they want to roll their stats again
    #value + 1 to make it so that the while loop can execute one more time
#functions time!
#there will be a function for each town, having slight stat changes over each like 
#there will be a function for combat which will look like this:
#def combat(health, opponent_health, monster_weapon)
    #monster hp will get defined
    #player health will go down or added depending on level and healing potions, healing potions will be defined later
#print statement that tells the user that they arrived at the first town, Belville
#yet another function for the shops in the cities, they will mostly have the same stuff, with some small diffs between the two
#a function will be set for the shop in the poor city and the rich city because of the gold being worth double or half
